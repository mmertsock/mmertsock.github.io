[The Mac is 40 years old][40]. Like myself, it's an elder millennial in age and spirit.

Time to reflect.

My first experience with the Mac was in the middle school computer lab: rows of beige plastic in various flavors of Macintosh LC and Color Classic.

<aside><p>
In hindsight it was a pretty great lab, well-stocked for a small-town school far from any city and always a decade behind the times.

The Macs at the lab were utterly unlike the 386 at home. My first experiences of the real Web—color graphics, Netscape—were on a Mac. [ClarisWorks][] my first encounter with a modern word processor. Lemmings and Carmen Sandiego! These machines were cheerful portals to a larger world, they invited creative experimentation and learning, they offered hopeful hints of the future.

But most importantly, these Macs had [HyperCard][].

The Spanish teacher delivered our weekly quizzes on HyperCard stacks. She wrote and distributed them herself! Soon I was building my own stories and games and little worlds in HyperCard. I knew I was playing with magic, but I didn't know it was my first step to a life of building software and digital creation.

Other early Macintosh experiences: pouring hours into MacPaint while visiting a family friend with an <a href="https://lowendmac.com/2014/powerbook-history-before-the-g3/">old PowerBook</a>, a tiny black plastic miracle with a soft grayscale TFT display. A relative's Bondi Blue. Staring at the lampshade <a href="https://www.imore.com/mac/imac/using-a-g4-imac-in-2023-to-mark-its-20th-anniversary">iMac G4</a> in the college library basement.

About a decade later, I bought my first Mac in preparation for working with grad school's Unix systems, an aluminum PowerBook G4. Mac OS X Tiger: what a perfect entry point to the modern Apple ecosystem.

Since then: a 2009 Intel iMac, a first-gen retina MacBook Pro, M1 iMac, and various work-furnished MacBooks Pro.

A lot has changed, but much has not changed.

Time to make something new again.
